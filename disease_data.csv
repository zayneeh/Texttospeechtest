Crop,Crop Disease,Prevention,Causes,Treatment
Tomato,Leaf Blight,"Use disease-resistant varieties of tomatoes where available. Ensure good air circulation around plants by spacing them appropriately and pruning. Avoid overhead watering to keep leaves dry.","This disease is caused by fungal pathogens such as Alternaria solani. The fungus thrives in warm, humid conditions and can persist in the soil or on infected plant debris.","Treat with fungicides specifically labeled for control of Alternaria species. Remove and destroy infected plant parts to prevent further spread."
Tomato,Leaf Curl,"Grow plants under conditions that avoid stress. Use silver reflective mulch to deter whiteflies, which can transmit viral diseases. Choose resistant varieties if available.","Tomato leaf curl can be caused by viruses spread by whiteflies, environmental stress (high temperatures, water stress), or herbicide exposure.","For viral causes, there is no cure once plants are infected. Remove and destroy infected plants. For environmental or chemical causes, mitigate stress factors."
Tomato,Septoria Leaf Spot,"Practice crop rotation every three to four years. Avoid overhead irrigation, clean up plant debris, and regularly weed your garden to reduce fungal sources. Remove and discard tomato, pepper, and eggplant plants immediately after they bear fruit, and replant them in a different area the following year.","Septoria leaf spot is caused by the fungus Septoria lycopersici, which persists in plant debris and is spread by water splashes, especially in humid conditions.","Apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil or mancozeb early in the season or at the first signs of disease. Remove affected leaves to reduce fungal load and prevent spread."
Tomato,Verticillium Wilt,"Use resistant or immune plant varieties marked with a 'V'. Rotate crops, and avoid planting susceptible varieties in affected soil for at least four years. Soil fumigation or solarization can help reduce fungal levels. Always follow product labels when applying treatments.","Verticillium wilt is caused by soil-borne fungi (Verticillium spp.) that infect a wide range of plants through the roots, blocking water and nutrient transport. It is particularly active in cool spring temperatures but may not show symptoms until later in the season.","There is no cure once plants are infected. Remove and dispose of affected plants (do not compost them). Prune and dispose of infected branches in landscape plants. Proper watering and plant care may extend life but will not cure the disease."
Maize,Fall Armyworm,"Regularly monitor fields and use pheromone traps for early detection. Implement cultural controls (destroy infested crop residues) and encourage natural enemies.","Fall armyworm is a caterpillar (Spodoptera frugiperda) that eats maize leaves, causing severe yield losses if not controlled.","Use recommended insecticides or biological products (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis) when pest thresholds are exceeded. Good field hygiene reduces population buildup."
Maize,Grasshopper,"Manage vegetation around fields to reduce breeding grounds. Encourage natural predators such as birds; use traps or barriers if feasible.","Various grasshopper species feed on maize leaves, causing significant defoliation when infestations are large.","Apply insecticides early in the infestation for effective control. Use integrated pest management (IPM) practices to keep populations in check."
Maize,Leaf Beetle,"Inspect fields regularly and remove weeds that may harbor beetles. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs or lacewings.","Small beetles feed on maize leaves, causing defoliation and reducing photosynthetic area.","Apply insecticides if damage becomes severe. Use IPM strategies and rotate insecticides to prevent resistance."
Maize,Leaf Blight,"Rotate crops and manage crop residue to reduce fungal spores. Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation.","Leaf blight is often caused by fungi such as Helminthosporium (Exserohilum) spp., which thrive in humid conditions and can overwinter in crop debris.","Use fungicidal sprays at the first sign of disease. Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum."
Maize,Leaf Spot,"Avoid dense planting and overhead watering. Practice crop rotation and field sanitation.","Leaf spot is caused by tiny fungi (e.g., Cercospora zeae-maydis) that create spots on leaves and can spread via wind or rain splash.","Fungicide application may be necessary if disease pressure is high. Removing infected debris helps limit spread."
Maize,Streak Virus,"Control the leafhopper vectors with appropriate insecticides or biological controls. Use resistant maize varieties if available.","Streak virus is transmitted by leafhoppers, causing streaks on leaves and reducing the plantâ€™s ability to perform photosynthesis.","No direct cure for viral infection. Remove and destroy infected plants to limit spread. Maintain good pest control to reduce vector populations."
Cassava,Bacterial Blight,"Use disease-free cuttings and maintain good field hygiene. Remove and destroy severely infected plants.","Bacteria (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis) infect cassava, causing leaf spots, wilting, and rotting of stems and roots.","Some copper-based bactericides may help reduce spread, but the primary method is using resistant varieties and removing infected material."
Cassava,Brown Spot,"Rotate crops and space plants to reduce humidity around leaves. Maintain good weed control.","Brown spot is caused by the fungus Cercospora henningsii, leading to brown lesions on leaves which may cause defoliation if severe.","Apply fungicides during periods of high humidity if the disease is severe. Remove and destroy heavily infected plant debris."
Cassava,Green Mite,"Inspect fields regularly and encourage predatory mites. Maintain plant vigor with proper fertilization and watering.","Green mites are tiny spider-like pests (Mononychellus spp.) that suck sap from cassava leaves, causing yellowing and weakened growth.","Use miticides if infestations become severe. Biological control (e.g., predatory mites) can be effective in reducing populations."
Cassava,Mosaic,"Use virus-free planting material. Control whiteflies that transmit the viruses with insecticidal or biological methods.","Mosaic diseases (e.g., Cassava mosaic virus) cause a patchy, mosaic pattern on leaves, stunting plants and reducing yields.","No cure once plants are infected. Remove and destroy infected plants. Replant with resistant varieties to reduce future outbreaks."
Cashew,Anthracnose,"Prune trees for better air circulation and remove infected fruits or twigs promptly. Avoid overcrowding.","Anthracnose is caused by fungi like Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, resulting in dark spots on leaves and fruits.","Apply fungicides during wet periods or at first sign of infection. Sanitize tools and remove infected plant parts to prevent spread."
Cashew,Gummosis,"Avoid wounds to the trunk and branches. Maintain tree health through proper nutrition and watering.","Gummosis often occurs when fungi infect wounds on cashew trees, causing sap to ooze and gum to form.","Cut away affected bark until healthy tissue is exposed. Treat wounds with fungicidal paste if recommended. Improve orchard hygiene."
Cashew,Leaf Miner,"Inspect leaves regularly for tunneling and remove heavily infested leaves. Encourage natural enemies (e.g., parasitic wasps).","Leaf miners are larvae of small moths or flies that tunnel between leaf surfaces, causing visible trails and weakening the plant.","Apply insecticides if infestation is heavy. Use sticky traps or introduce biological controls to reduce leaf miner populations."
Cashew,Red Rust,"Maintain good tree nutrition, reduce plant stress, and prune to allow better airflow.","Red rust is caused by algae (Cephaleuros virescens), creating rusty-red patches on leaves and stems that can reduce photosynthesis.","Apply copper-based fungicides/algaecides if the infestation is severe. Prune out heavily affected parts to limit spread."
